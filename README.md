# GA-proj-4-wnv
This is a github repo of my contributions to a group project.

Utilizing weather, geographic, and mosquito collection data from Chicago, my team was able to build a model that predicted where and when mosquito populations would increase and if they would be likely carriers of the West Nile Virus. We then did a cost-benefit analysis on the effects of spraying pesticide to control the mosquito population and thus the spread of the disease. Our model was able to predict 81% of actual cases of WNV based on our test data. We also score a .77355 on the Roc Auc score (used to find the winner on Kaggle).
